# trello-csv

This is a quick tool to export basic data from a Trello board. It's not a command-line tool or script (although you can run it locally if you wish) - instead, it's accessible via [a Github Pages site](http://joshmcarthur.github.io/trello-csv).

It was thrown together as a prototype, so no particular guaruntee is made to it's durability or operation. If you do encounter problems or have feature suggestions though, please do report them via [the Github issue tracker](https://github.com/joshmcarthur/trello-csv).

### Development

There's not much to this application, but the scripts are written in [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org), and patches submitted in Coffeescript are preferred. You can automatically watch and recompile coffeescript if you have the `coffee` npm package installed, by running `coffee -cwo javascripts coffeescripts`.
